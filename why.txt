On the crafting page, when selection items, should you be able to select multiple categories?
* The list will be longer, we wanna keep it as short as possible due to the small screens.
* You would have to check and uncheck to be able to swap from eg "Forest" to "Jungle" matsâ€¦

There is no way to view common mats.
* The common mats will show up ragardless of region when selecting fine or basic.
* There is no reason to have a common button.
